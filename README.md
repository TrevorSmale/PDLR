## Personal Learning Notes
While I take these courses, I like to take notes using MarkDown and upload them to a repo. My notes differ from course to course in respect to the difficulty or nature of the course. Some courses are information dense requiring more memorization, while others are simple and interactive. When I get a chance, I will go back and review/clean up these notes for future reference.
